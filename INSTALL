To build the library:
	make		(This will make both libsafe.so as well as some sample
			 exploits)
	make install	(make install must be done as root)

The makefile will only copy the library and man page to the appropriate
directories.  To activate libsafe, either on a per-process basis or on a
system-wide basis, see the man page (doc/libsafe.8, Section "Installing
libsafe").

See http://www.research.avayalabs.com/project/libsafe/index.html for more info.

Build problems and notes:

If you wish to obtain a core dump or stack dump of a program that has been
terminated by libsafe, compile libsafe with the the desired debugging options
enabled.  See "DEBUGGING OPTIONS" in libsafe/src/Makefile.  You can also do a
"make debug".

If you get a compiler error about environ already being defined, comment out
line 40 in libsafe/src/util.c.

If your system doesn't have the file ansidecl.h, you can find the file in the
Debian package.  See ftp://ftp.rademaker.dhs.org/pub/debian/binary-i386/.
Thanks to Ron Rademaker for creating the Debian package.
