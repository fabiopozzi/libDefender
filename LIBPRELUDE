If libsafe is compiled on a system with libprelude installed, libsafe will
additionally emit a stack overflow alert to the Prelude Manager.

Using libprelude, libsafe becomes a Prelude sensor, and acquires the ability
to issue alerts to the Prelude Manager.  This allows you to centralize
reports from distributed sensors in one place, and allows you to correlate
events detected by different sensors (for more information about the
Prelude Hybrid IDS, please see http://www.prelude-ids.org).

In order for libsafe to be able to contact the Prelude Manager, you'll
have a little configuration to do first:

    1.  Run the manager-adduser program on the Prelude Manager host.
    2.  Run the sensor-adduser program, on the sensor host with the following
	    arguments : sensor-adduser --sensorname libsafe --uid <uid of the
	    libsafe protected program> --manager-addr <address of the Prelude
	    Manager>

That's all you have to do to enable your libsafe-protected application
to report to Prelude.

The Libsafe/Prelude configuration is stored in the default sensor configuration
file: /etc/prelude-sensors/sensors-default.conf.

This configuration file should contain settings like the Prelude Manager
address, so that a given sensor knows where an alert should be emitted.
